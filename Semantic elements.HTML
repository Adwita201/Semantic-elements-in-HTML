                <h2> Rabbits</h2> 
                <p>Rabbits make good house pets for many households,even if you like in an apartment. They love to chew things, and really love digging sand.
                    They eat carrots, apples and celery as sweet treats, but eat hay as their regular diet. There are many colours, such as beige,black, white,spotted and more!
                    They hop around and jump if they ever want something above them.
